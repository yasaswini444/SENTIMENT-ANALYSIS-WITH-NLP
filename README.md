Sentiment Analysis is a type of natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. It helps identify whether the text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
What Does Sentiment Analysis Do?
It analyzes text data — such as:
Product reviews
Social media posts
Customer feedback
News articles
—to figure out how people feel about a particular topic, product, or service.
 How It Works:
Text preprocessing – Remove punctuation, lowercase, stop words, etc.
Feature extraction – Use tools like:
Bag of Words
TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)
Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT)
Classification – Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks) on labeled data (positive/negative).
Common Applications:
Analyzing product reviews (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart)
Social media monitoring (e.g., Twitter sentiment about a brand)
Customer support sentiment tracking
Financial forecasting from news sentiment
